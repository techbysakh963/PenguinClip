## Reporting a Vulnerability

### 🔒 Private Disclosure

Instead, please report security issues via one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/techbysakh963/PenguinClip/security/advisories/new)

2. **Email**: gustaavoribeeiro@hotmail.com

### 📝 What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Status Update**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 24-72 hours
  - High: 1 week
  - Medium: 2 weeks

### 🎁 Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who help keep our project safe. With your permission, we will:

- Acknowledge your contribution in release notes
- Add you to our security hall of fame (if created in the future)

## Security Best Practices

When using PenguinClip:

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Build from Source**: When possible, verify the source code
3. **Check Signatures**: Verify release artifacts when available
4. **Report Issues**: Help us by reporting any suspicious behavior

## Known Security Considerations

### Clipboard Data

- Clipboard history is stored **locally only**
- No data is transmitted over the network
- History is stored in memory (not persisted to disk by default)
- Sensitive data copied to clipboard will be stored in history

### Permissions

- **Global hotkey capture**: Required for global shortcuts (Super+V, Ctrl+Alt+V)
- **System tray**: For background operation
- **Clipboard access**: Core functionality

### Wayland Security

On Wayland, clipboard access follows the compositor's security model, which may restrict access to clipboard contents from background applications in some configurations.
